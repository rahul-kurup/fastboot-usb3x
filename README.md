# Fastboosted USB 3.x

> Toggle support for ADB and Fastboot commands on USB 3.x ports

[This is a Windows-only utility]

ADB and FB commands works properly on USB 2.x ports.\
But as soon as you connect your android device to 3.x port, FB commands starts to fail abruptly!

This utility file can toggle USB 3.x ports to support FB commands by manipulating registry entries (changing values present in `usbflags` key).
